# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a reusable GitHub Action that automates the deployment of CloudFormation stacks from infrastructure code stored in GitHub repositories. The action will provide a standardized way to deploy AWS infrastructure with configurable parameters, proper error handling, and deployment monitoring capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to deploy CloudFormation stacks using a reusable GitHub Action, so that I can standardize infrastructure deployments across multiple repositories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the action is invoked THEN the system SHALL accept three input parameters: stack-name, stack-path, and deployment-parameters
2. WHEN the action runs THEN the system SHALL validate that the CloudFormation template file exists at the specified path
3. WHEN the template file does not exist THEN the system SHALL fail with a clear error message
4. WHEN the action completes successfully THEN the system SHALL deploy the CloudFormation stack with the specified name

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to pass deployment parameters in JSON format, so that I can configure my infrastructure dynamically without modifying the template.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment parameters are provided as JSON THEN the system SHALL parse and convert them to CloudFormation parameter format
2. WHEN parameters are in CloudFormation array format THEN the system SHALL process them as ParameterName/ParameterValue pairs
3. WHEN parameters are in simple key-value format THEN the system SHALL convert them to CloudFormation parameter overrides
4. WHEN no parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL deploy the stack without parameter overrides
5. WHEN parameter parsing fails THEN the system SHALL fail with a descriptive error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want real-time monitoring of CloudFormation deployment progress, so that I can track the status and troubleshoot issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a deployment starts THEN the system SHALL display the stack name, template path, and parameters being used
2. WHEN the deployment is in progress THEN the system SHALL continuously monitor and display CloudFormation stack events
3. WHEN stack events are retrieved THEN the system SHALL show timestamp, status, resource type, logical ID, and status reason
4. WHEN the deployment completes THEN the system SHALL display final stack events and outputs
5. WHEN monitoring fails THEN the system SHALL continue deployment but log monitoring errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want the action to handle IAM capabilities automatically, so that my CloudFormation stacks can create IAM resources without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying any stack THEN the system SHALL include CAPABILITY_IAM and CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capabilities
2. WHEN the stack requires IAM permissions THEN the system SHALL proceed without additional user confirmation
3. WHEN capabilities are insufficient THEN the system SHALL fail with AWS CloudFormation error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a CI/CD pipeline maintainer, I want proper error handling and exit codes, so that my pipeline can respond appropriately to deployment failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the deployment succeeds THEN the system SHALL exit with code 0 and display success message
2. WHEN the deployment fails THEN the system SHALL exit with code 1 and display failure message
3. WHEN template validation fails THEN the system SHALL exit early with appropriate error code
4. WHEN AWS CLI commands fail THEN the system SHALL propagate the error and exit appropriately
5. WHEN no changes are detected THEN the system SHALL complete successfully with no-fail-on-empty-changeset behavior

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a GitHub Actions user, I want the action to be properly structured and documented, so that I can easily integrate it into my workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the action is published THEN the system SHALL include proper action.yaml metadata with name, description, and input definitions
2. WHEN users reference the action THEN the system SHALL provide clear input parameter documentation
3. WHEN the action runs THEN the system SHALL use appropriate GitHub Actions syntax and conventions
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages with context
